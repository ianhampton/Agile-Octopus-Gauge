# Agile Octopus Gauge
 Displays a gauge indicating the current Agile Octopus unit rate in your area. Updates automatically using AJAX.
 
 The intention is that this page can be left running on a spare phone or tablet.

## Installation
 Update the code to use your Octopus product code and tariff code. [The values can be found here](https://octopus.energy/dashboard/developer/).
 Run somewhere locally or remotely.

## Limitations
 Negative (plunge) pricing drops off the bottom of the gauge. I quite like this :)
